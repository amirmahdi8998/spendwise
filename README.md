#### Description

SpendWise is a personal finance management web application built with Flask. The main motivation behind this project was the common question many people ask themselves at the end of each month: *“Where did all my money go?”*. With so many small expenses throughout the month, it can be very difficult to track where money is actually being spent. SpendWise tries to solve this issue by providing a simple and user-friendly platform where users can log both their income and expenses, view their transaction history, and gain better insights into their financial habits.

The project was designed with simplicity in mind. I wanted something that would be easy to set up, require minimal technical knowledge from the user, and at the same time serve as a solid learning project for me as a student of CS50. By building this project, I was able to practice concepts such as web development with Flask, database management with SQL, user authentication and sessions, as well as HTML, CSS, and templating with Jinja. While the project is not meant to be a professional financial management tool, it demonstrates many of the core principles of full-stack web development in a way that is approachable for beginners.

From a functionality perspective, the application allows users to register for an account and log in securely. Each user has their own account where their data is stored separately. Once logged in, users can add transactions that are either income or expense. Each transaction requires a description, an amount, and a category, which helps later when viewing the history of spending. All transactions are stored in a SQLite database, which is lightweight and sufficient for the scale of this project. Users can then view their transaction history in reverse chronological order and analyze their spending patterns.

In terms of design, I debated whether to use a more complex frontend framework like React, but I decided against it because the purpose of the project was to learn Flask and keep the interface simple. Instead, I used basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for styling. This choice made the application lighter, easier to deploy, and more focused on backend logic rather than frontend complexity. I also considered adding more advanced features such as graphs or charts to visualize spending, but I decided to leave that as a possible improvement for the future.

The project structure is fairly straightforward. The main logic lives in `app.py`, which contains the Flask routes and database queries. The `templates` folder contains the HTML templates, each corresponding to a different page such as the home page, login, register, and history. The `static` folder holds the CSS files and any static assets. The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, such as Flask and SQLAlchemy. By organizing the project in this way, it remains clean, modular, and easy to understand for anyone who wishes to explore or extend it.

During development, I faced several challenges. One issue was implementing user authentication securely. I had to learn how to hash passwords before storing them in the database and how to manage user sessions so that data remained private. Another challenge was handling input validation: ensuring that users could not submit invalid data such as negative amounts for expenses or empty transaction descriptions. These challenges helped me gain a deeper understanding of backend validation and security practices. I also experimented with different database schemas before deciding on a simple one with just a single `transactions` table linked to users, as this kept the project scope manageable.

Looking to the future, there are many improvements I could add to SpendWise. For example, I could integrate a graphing library to show visual breakdowns of spending by category, or I could allow users to export their data to CSV for use in other applications. Another idea is to set budget goals and alert users when they are close to exceeding them. These would make the application more useful in real life, but even in its current form, SpendWise fulfills its educational purpose.

Overall, SpendWise is a project that I am proud of because it not only demonstrates the skills I learned in CS50 but also solves a real problem that many people face. Building it taught me about the full cycle of web development: designing an idea, structuring a database, writing backend code, creating frontend pages, handling user input, and thinking about usability and design decisions. The project might be simple, but it reflects careful thought, experimentation, and learning.

In conclusion, this project represents my progress in becoming a better programmer. Through SpendWise, I practiced critical skills like problem-solving, debugging, and writing clean and maintainable code. More importantly, I learned how to think about the user experience and the importance of making software not only functional but also easy to use. I believe this project captures the essence of what CS50 encourages: to take an idea, however small, and turn it into a working product that you can share with others. For me, SpendWise was the perfect opportunity to combine my interest in technology with a practical, real-world problem, and I look forward to building on this foundation in the future.
